# ⚠️ Auto-Generated Files

This folder contains the output of the core `identity-generator` module from the `/core` directory in the AliasVault project.

**Do not edit any of these files manually.**

To make changes:
1. Update the source files in the `/core/typescript/identity-generator/src` directory
2. Run the `build.sh` script in the module directory to regenerate the outputs and copy them here.
