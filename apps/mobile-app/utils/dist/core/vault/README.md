# ⚠️ Auto-Generated Files

This folder contains the output of the core `vault` module from the `/core` directory in the AliasVault project.

**Do not edit any of these files manually.**

To make changes:
1. Update the source files in the `/core/vault/src` directory
2. Run the `build.sh` script in the module directory to regenerate the outputs and copy them here.
