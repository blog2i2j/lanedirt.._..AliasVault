// This file serves as a placeholder to ensure the RustCoreFramework module is created.
// All Rust Core functionality is provided by the UniFFI-generated Swift bindings
// in RustCore/Generated/aliasvault_core.swift, which are automatically exported
// as part of this framework.

// The filterCredentialsJson function and any other Rust functions are available
// directly when importing RustCoreFramework, no additional re-export needed.
