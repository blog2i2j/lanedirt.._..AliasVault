  Data extraction rules for Android API 31+ (Android 12 and above).
  Disables all cloud backups and device transfers.

  AliasVault is an end-to-end encrypted vault app. All app data — including the encrypted
  vault database, Keystore-wrapped encryption keys, authentication tokens, and key derivation
  parameters — is security-sensitive and device-bound. So backups are disabled entirely.
