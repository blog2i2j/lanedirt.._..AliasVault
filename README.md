## Self-hosting
> [!NOTE]
> **Requirements:** 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM, 16GB disk, Docker ‚â• 20.10, 64-bit Linux

AliasVault can be self-hosted on your own servers using two different installation methods. Both use Docker, but they differ in how much is automated versus how much you manage yourself.

- **Option 1: Install Script** - Managed solution with automatic SSL (recommended for VPS/cloud)

- **Option 2: Docker Compose** - Single container with manual setup for use with existing SSL infrastructure (NAS, homelab)

### Quick Start (Install Script)
```bash
# Download and run install script
curl -L -o install.sh https://github.com/aliasvault/aliasvault/releases/latest/download/install.sh

# Make install script executable and run it. This will create the .env file, pull the Docker images, and start the AliasVault containers.
chmod +x install.sh

./install.sh install
```

For other installation methods and more detailed steps, please read the [full installation guide](https://docs.aliasvault.net/installation) in the official docs.

## Documentation
For more information about the installation process, manual setup instructions and other topics, please see the official documentation website:

## Security Architecture
<a href="https://docs.aliasvault.net/architecture"><img alt="AliasVault Security Architecture Diagram" src="docs/assets/diagrams/security-architecture/aliasvault-security-architecture-thumb.jpg" width="343"></a>

AliasVault takes security seriously and implements various measures to protect your data:

- All sensitive user data is encrypted end-to-end using industry-standard encryption algorithms. This includes the complete vault contents and all received emails.
- Your master password never leaves your device.
- Zero-knowledge architecture ensures the server never has access to your unencrypted data

For detailed information about our encryption implementation and security architecture, see the following documents:
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Security Architecture Diagram](https://docs.aliasvault.net/architecture)
